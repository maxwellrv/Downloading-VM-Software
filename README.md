# Downloading-VM-Software
As I have grown and gained experience understanding how networks operate, virtual machine technology seems to continuously amaze me anytime it gets a chance. For anyone wanting to make a career change into tech or simply starting their technology journey with networking, this piece of software should not be overlooked in any way. 
Virtual machines take up a fraction of the power that a typical home lab rack would require and it virtually takes up zero space as long as your current PC hardware can support the boxes you would like to run virtually. In addition to the cost and space efficiency, there is also a level of insurance that is applied when deciding to utilize VM software. If given the proper configurations, you can break your box a million different ways and not have to fret about any negative effects when concerning your actual home network. 
In all honesty, I could go on and on with how much I enjoy and would recommend this type of tool to any tech enthusiast, however, my main objective with this writing is not that. I am wanting to give a brief intro and explanation on virtual machines and how to download one onto your personal computer. 
The VM software I am choosing for this guide is open source, popular, and most importantly free. 
My first pick when entering the VM world was VirtualBox by Oracle. If just starting out with VM tech, this would definitely be my first suggestion because it is very easy to download and user friendly once ready to start deploying your own virtual operating systems. 
You can first begin with simply typing “Virtual Box” into your search engine and hitting enter. The website should be one of the top options and titled “Oracle VM VirtualBox”.

You’ll then want to click on that title and be brought to the home page.

Navigate to the left of the menu and click on “Downloads”.

This part will now be more on your preferences and what machine you want to run your VMs on. Since I am currently using a Windows PC, I click on the “Windows hosts” option under “VirtualBox 7.0.20 platform packages”. A file should be sent to your downloads section after selecting your link. Once completed, go to your downloads and select the Win.exe file. 

Select “yes” when prompted with the user account control prompt. There should then be a welcome prompt from VirtualBox where you will need to select “next” at the bottom. There will then be a short series of options you will be given before installing and running the software fully. My recommendation, if you’re just starting and not sure what to do, is to just select all of the default options that you should be prompted with and not change anything until you have gotten more experience with using VirtualBox. You also may be prompted at a certain point asking to install certain dependencies. Select “yes” to install them.

Select “install” when finished.

Select “finish” and be sure that you are configured to start VirtualBox after installation.

Congratulations on downloading what I find to be one of the most valuable tools you could have as a tech professional. I can almost guarantee that you will see and likely need to utilize this technology some time in your professional career and hopefully you will appreciate the experience that is able to be built now to prepare for when that time comes. 
Thank you for reading this guide and be sure to read any other articles or projects if you're curious.
